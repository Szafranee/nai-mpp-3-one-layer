David Villa Sánchez (Spanish pronunciation: [daˈβið ˈbiʎa santʃeθ]; born 3 December 1981) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a striker.
Villa is regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation, and one of the greatest Spanish players of all time.
He is currently working as the Technical Advisor and Head of Global Football Operations for Indian Super League club Odisha FC.
He is the all-time top goalscorer for Spain.
Nicknamed El Guaje (The Kid in Asturian) due to a reputation of playing football with children much older than him, Villa sustained a serious injury as a child but managed to start his professional career with Sporting de Gijón in 2001.
He moved to Real Zaragoza after two seasons, where he made his La Liga debut, and won the Copa del Rey and Supercopa de España.
He joined Valencia in 2005 for a transfer fee of €12 million and captured another Copa del Rey title.
After a five-season tenure in Valencia where Villa elevated into one of the best players in La Liga, he signed for Barcelona for €40 million in 2010.
In his first season, he won his first La Liga and UEFA Champions League titles, scoring in the 2011 final.
He left the club in 2013 after transferring to Atlético Madrid, where he won another La Liga title and reached the 2014 UEFA Champions League final.
After a single season in the Spanish capital, Villa departed to join new MLS franchise New York City, where he became the club's record goalscorer and appearance maker, winning the MLS MVP Award for best player in 2016.
In 2018, Villa announced his departure from New York, to join Vissel Kobe in Japan before retiring in 2020.
