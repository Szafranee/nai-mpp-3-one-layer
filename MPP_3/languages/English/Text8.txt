Robert Lewandowski (Polish pronunciation: [ˈrɔbɛrt lɛvanˈdɔfskʲi]; born 21 August 1988) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a striker for La Liga club Barcelona and captains the Poland national team.
He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as one of the most successful players in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history.
He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.
After being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszków, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Poznań, helping the team win the 2009–10 Ekstraklasa.
In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award.
In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final.
Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer.
In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons.
Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019–20 as part of a treble.
He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer.
Lewandowski is also one of only two players to be top goalscorer for club and country in Europe for three consecutive years (2019–21), alongside Cristiano Ronaldo.
He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d'Or, until it was canceled.
In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de España, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season.
He holds the joint-record for most top scorer awards in Europe's top five leagues with eight, alongside Lionel Messi, and the record for the most consecutive with six.
