Carmichaelia juncea was first identified botanically by the British explorer and botanist Sir Joseph Hooker. In 1839 he joined the Antarctic expedition led by Sir James Ross as assistant surgeon and naturalist on board the Erebus. During the southern winter of 1841 he spent three months based in the Bay of Islands collecting plants.[3] Once he had returned to England he corresponded with many New Zealand plant collectors, encouraging them, sending news and advice and in return receiving specimens to add to his collection. His first book on New Zealand plants Flora Novae-Zelandiae was published in 1853.[4]

Originally several species similar to Carmichaelia juncea were described. One of these species was found growing on lake shores along the east coast of the South Island. By 1993 (along with most other members of this group) it had not been seen or collected in over 50 years and was presumed extinct. Amazingly that year it was "re-discovered" growing in a rock garden at the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens.[5] In 1995 this small group of Carmichaelia species were all combined as one species, C. juncea.[5] The epithet juncea means 'rush-like' in Greek.[5]

Description
Carmichaelia juncea is a low growing prostrate shrub that forms a sprawling mat (20 cm (7.9 in) high and up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) wide), looking very like a clump of dying rushes. The switch-like branchlets are light green to light brown, with very few leaves. The flowers are small and white with purple highlights. The seed pods are short and black, the seeds probably wind distributed.[5][6] C. juncea flowers between October and January and fruits between November and March.[2]
